## Blog - V2
In addition to what was done in V1, Here I added 'sign in' and 'sign up' functionality. After a user signs up, they are able
to create posts as well as edit/update posts. When a user is not signed in, they cannot create posts or edit posts. Please note that the way my project is set up, a user who is not logged in can locally edit the posts, but these edits are not saved, so when they go back to the main posts page, the post remains as it originally was. Everything worked well on this part of the lab. I did have a bug where the token was not being returned, but that was fixed.
